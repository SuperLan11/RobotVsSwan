# The Making of Swan Showdown
Swan Showdown was a game created for a game jam that lasted seven days. 
The jam had a prompt that included a theme and special object to implement into the game.
The theme for the jam was "you are the final boss," and the special object was a swan.
To fit the theme, the player controls a robot final boss and attacks swan heroes.
